Project Details:
Go Fish algorithm

State of the project:
Incomplete; Card, Player and Deck classes created - can shuffle cards and draw hands to assign it to players for now

Feedback:
Stuck at the portion where pair of cards is to be removed from the inital hand dealt. Weirdly, it is removing just one of the instance of the 
matching cards.
